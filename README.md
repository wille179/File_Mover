# Filemover 
 
Filemover is a short project I created for my father. It allows for the movement of a large batch of files with a patterned naming system to be selected using a list of numbers. As my father often recieves a numbered list of photos from his clients, it allows him to quickly select and isolate a large number of files without needing to manually locate them one at a time.
